\noindent{\bf "I love limericks"}\vspace{12pt}\\
A mathematician confided:\\
a M{\"o}bius strip is one-sided.\\
You'll get quite a laugh\\
if you cut one in half,\\
for it stays in one piece when divided.\vspace{12pt}\\

\noindent{\bf "If you were a bird, what bird would you be and why?"}\vspace{12pt}\\
I'd like to be a k$\overline{\mbox{a}}$k$\overline{\mbox{a}}$p$\overline{\mbox{o}}$,
a flightless and solitary parrot native to New Zealand. I'm petrified of heights, so flightless
is good. I also like to be alone, so spending 100 years in a forest in New Zealand with no fear
of natural predators sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me. \vspace{12pt}\\

\noindent{\bf "please send me your best pun"}\vspace{12pt}\\
